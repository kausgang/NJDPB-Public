## üöÄ 1. Project Setup&#x20;

This project consists of:

- **Spring Boot Application** (`SpringWebsiteMonitorApplication.java`)
- **Website Monitoring Service** (`WebsiteMonitor.java`)
- **Unit Tests** (`WebsiteMonitorTest.java`)
- **Maven Dependencies** (`pom.xml`)
- **Configuration File** (`application.properties`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. How It Works&#x20;

The application performs two main functions:

1. **Website Availability Check**: Sends an HTTP request to a specified URL and checks if it responds.
2. **SSL Certificate Check**: Retrieves the SSL certificate, extracts the expiration date, and calculates the remaining validity.

## ‚úÖ 6. Testing the Application&#x20;

To run unit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Sample Test Cases

- `testWebsiteReachability()`: Ensures the website is reachable.
- `testSSLCertificate()`: Checks SSL certificate validity.
